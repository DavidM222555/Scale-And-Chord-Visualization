# Scale-And-Chord-Visualization
A web application built using Flask along with JS/HTML/CSS that shows scales and chords on a small keyboard for aspiring music students wanting to learn visually. The way it is meant to be used, considering it is a highly truncated keyboard, is that the person locates the starting note and begins there and works their way back around on the keyboard, as opposed to playing from right to left fully (which in the case of chords would give you inverted chords instead of the actual chord). This is something I might consider refining in the future but currently the main point is there.

# How to run
To run this application on Windows you need to have Flask installed (you can simply use pip install flask). Once you are CD'd into top directory of the program you can run the following in the command prompt "set FLASK_APP=main.py" and then to execute the application on your local network you can do "flask run". 

# Future improvements
- Further refine the GUI of the app and make it look more appealing.
- Add functionality for guitar students to visualize chords and scales on the guitar. 
- Clean up the code a bit and possibly refactor.
